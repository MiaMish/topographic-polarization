    # Success rate: the rate of successful interactions among all interactions in the
    # final 1000 rounds of the simulation.

    # Mean absolute correlation: For each pair of traits we measure their
    # correlation in the population, take the absolute value and compute the
    # mean.

    # Near pairs / far pairs: We measured the ratio of pair of individuals that are
    # near each other, among all pairs of individuals, and similarly for far pairs. A
    # near pair is defined as a pair such that their maximal distance between traits
    # is at most s (the interaction success threshold), and in a far pair the minimal
    # distance is at least 2-s. I.e., a near pair is likely to interact successfully for
    # every trait, and the opposite is true for a far pair.

    # Mid-ratio: the ratio of individuals that have at least one trait within the range
    # [-0.8,0.8].

    # Num of stable regions - stable region := all agents has 0% to interact with...

    # spread can be measured as the value of the
    # agent with the highest belief value minus the value of the agent with the
    # lowest belief value (sometimes called the ‘range’ of the data).

    # Any of various measures of statistical dispersion might be used: mean difference, average absolute deviation, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, or entropy.

    # The proportion of empty bins
    # will then constitute a measure of polarization as coverage. That discrete
    # measure, although simple, depends on the choice of bins: varying the width
    # or location of bins can alter the measure for the same underlying data

    # coverage: uncovered opinion spaces corresponds directly to the concept of coverage

    # Community Fracturing: num of local min points

    # exogenous groups, we can instead measure the overlap of the two
    # groups;

    # distance between
    # group means, whether those groups are defined endogenously or exogenously.

    # If the groups are fully distinct,
    # then one can also find the distance between the maximum value in one group
    # to the minimum value in the next, that is, the width of the empty space between the groups.

    # measure of groups consensus is the absolute deviation within each group, aggregated over all the groups (e.g., the sizeweighted average).

    # rolling average: prop of successful interactions

    # size parity sum of the differences in size of each group from the mean group
    # size.
